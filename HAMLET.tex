\section{Hamlett}
Hamlett re-analyses the data of \citet{lam} to generalize their model to cover other settings not covered by the Lam method.

In many cases, repeated observation are collected from each subject in sequence  and/or longitudinally.


\[ y_i = \alpha + \mu_i + \epsilon \]


\subsection
The classical model is based on measurements $y_{mi}$
by method $m=1,2$ on item $i = 1,2 \ldots$

\[y_{mi} + \alpha_{m} + \mu_{i} + e_{mi}\]

\[e_{mi} \sim \mathcal{n} (0,\sigma^2_m)\]

Even though the separate variances can not be
identified, their sum can be estimated by the empirical variance of the differences.

Like wise the separate $\alpha$ can not be
estimated, only theiir difference can be estimated as
$\bar{D}$

\section{Hamlett and Lam}
The methodology proposed by \citet{Roy2009} is largely based on \citet{hamlett}, which in turn follows on from \citet{lam}.
