\subsection{Roy's methodology}

For the purposes of comparing two methods of measurement, \citet{roy} presents a methodology utilizing linear mixed effects model. This methodology provides for the formal testing of inter-method bias, between-subject variability and within-subject variability of two methods. The formulation contains a Kronecker product covariance structure in a doubly multivariate setup. By doubly multivariate set up, Roy means that the information on each patient or item is multivariate at two levels, the number of methods and number of replicated measurements. Further to \citet{lam}, it is assumed that the replicates are linked over time. However it is easy to modify to the unlinked case.

\citet{roy} sets out three criteria for two methods to be considered in agreement. Firstly that there be no significant bias. Second that there is no difference in the between-subject variabilities, and lastly that there is no significant difference in the within-subject variabilities. Roy further proposes examination of the the overall variability by considering the second and third criteria be examined jointly. Should both the second and third criteria be fulfilled, then the overall variabilities of both methods would be equal.

A formal test for inter-method bias can be implemented by examining the fixed effects of the model. This is common to well known classical linear model methodologies. The null hypotheses, that both methods have the same mean, which is tested against the alternative hypothesis, that both methods have different means.
The inter-method bias and necessary $t-$value and $p-$value are presented in computer output. A decision on whether the first of Roy's criteria is fulfilled can be based on these values.

Importantly \citet{roy} further proposes a series of three tests on the variance components of an LME model, which allow decisions on the second and third of Roy's criteria. For these tests, four candidate LME models are constructed. The differences in the models are specifically in how the the $D$ and $\Lambda$ matrices are constructed, using either an unstructured form or a compound symmetry form. To illustrate these differences, consider a generic matrix $A$,

\[
\boldsymbol{A} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    a_{11} & a_{12}  \\
    a_{21} & a_{22}  \\
    \end{array}\right).
\]

A symmetric matrix allows the diagonal terms $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$ to differ. The compound symmetry structure requires that both of these terms be equal, i.e $a_{11} = a_{22}$.

The first model acts as an alternative hypothesis to be compared against each of three other models, acting as null hypothesis models, successively. The models are compared using the likelihood ratio test. Likelihood ratio tests are a class of tests based on the comparison of the values of the likelihood functions of two candidate models. LRTs can be used to test hypotheses about covariance parameters or fixed effects parameters in the context of LMEs. The test statistic for the likelihood ratio test is the difference of the log-likelihood functions, multiplied by $-2$.
The probability distribution of the test statistic is approximated by the $\chi^2$ distribution with ($\nu_{1} - \nu_{2}$) degrees of freedom, where $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2}$ are the degrees of freedom of models 1 and 2 respectively. Each of these three test shall be examined in more detail shortly.

\section{Roy's LME approach}

\newpage



The methodology uses a linear mixed effects regression fit using
compound symmetry (CS) correlation structure on \textbf{V}.


$\Lambda = \frac{\mbox{max}_{H_{0}}L}{\mbox{max}_{H_{1}}L}$

\newpage

\citet{ARoy2009} considers the problem of assessing the agreement
between two methods with replicate observations in a doubly
multivariate set-up using linear mixed effects models.


\citet{ARoy2009} uses examples from \citet{BA86} to be able to
compare both types of analysis.



For the the RV-IC comparison, $\hat{D}$ is given by


\begin{equation}
\hat{D}= \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  1.6323 & 1.1427  \\
  1.1427 & 1.4498 \\
\end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

The estimate for the within-subject variance covariance matrix is
given by
\begin{equation}
\hat{\Sigma}= \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  0.1072 & 0.0372  \\
  0.0372 & 0.1379  \\
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}
The estimated overall variance covariance matrix for the the 'RV
vs IC' comparison is given by
\begin{equation}
Block \Omega_{i}= \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
  1.7396 & 1.1799  \\
  1.1799 & 1.5877  \\
\end{array} \right].
\end{equation}

 The power of the
likelihood ratio test may depends on specific sample size and the
specific number of  replications, and the author proposes
simulation studies to examine this further.

\section{Roy's LME methodology for assessing agreement}

\citet{Barnhart}  describes the sources of disagreement as
differing population means, different between-subject variances,
different within-subject variances between two methods and poor
correlation between measurements of two methods.


\citet{ARoy2009}proposes the use of LME models to perform a test
on two methods of agreement to determine whether they can be used
interchangeably.

Bivariate correlation coefficients have been shown to be of
limited use in method comparison studies \citep{BA86}. However,
recently correlation analysis has been developed to cope with
repeated measurements, enhancing their potential usefulness. Roy
incorporates the use of correlation into his methodology.


\citet{ARoy2009} considers the problem of assessing the agreement
between two methods with replicate observations in a doubly
multivariate set-up using linear mixed effects models.


\citet{ARoy2009} uses examples from \citet{BA86} to be able to
compare both types of analysis.

\citet{ARoy2009} proposes a LME based approach with Kronecker
product covariance structure with doubly multivariate setup to
assess the agreement between two methods. This method is designed
such that the data may be unbalanced and with unequal numbers of
replications for each subject.

\citet{ARoy2009} considers four independent hypothesis tests.
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing of hypotheses of differences between the means of
two methods\item Testing of hypotheses in between subject
variabilities in two methods, \item Testing of hypotheses of
differences in within-subject variability of the two methods,
\item Testing of hypotheses in differences in overall variability
of the two methods.
\end{itemize}


\section{Replicates}
Measurements taken in quick succession by the same observer using the same instrument on the same subject can be considered true replicates. \citet{Roy2009} notes that some measurements may not be `true' replicates.

Roy's methodology assumes the use of `true replicates'. However data may not be collected in this way. In such cases, the correlation matrix on the replicates may require a different structure, such as the autoregressive order one $AR(1)$ structure. However determining MLEs with such a structure would be computational intense, if possible at all.

\section{Roy's methodology with single measurements}

\section{Correlation indices}
\citet{roy} remarks that PROC MIXED only gives overall correlation coefficients, but not their variances. Consequently it is not possible to carry out inferences based on all overall correlation coefficients.


\section{Roy's examples}
Roy provides three case studies, using data sets well known in method comparison studies, to demonstrate how the methodology should be used.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 1a  ----  JSR Data %

The first case study is the Systolic blood pressure data, taken from \citet{BA99}.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 1b  ----  JSR Data %

To complete the study, the relevant values are provided for the $R \mbox{vs} S$ comparison also.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 2  ----  PEFR Data %

The second data set, a comparison of two peak expiratory flow rate measurements, is referenced by \citet{BA86}.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 3 Cardiac Ejection Fraction Data %
The last case study is also based on a data set from  \citet{BA99}. It contains the measurements of left ventricular cardiac eject fraction, measured by impedance cartography and radionuclide ventriculography, on twelve patients.
The number of replicated differs for each patient.

The bias is shown to be $0.7040$, with a p-value of $0.0204$. The MLEa of the between-method and within-method variance-covariance matrices of methods $RV$ and $IC$ are given by

\begin{equation}\hat{D}=\left(
                                      \begin{array}{cc}
                                        1.6323 & 1.1427 \\
                                        1.1427 & 1.4498 \\
                                      \end{array}
                                    \right),
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}\hat{\Sigma}=\left(
                                      \begin{array}{cc}
                                        1.6323 & 1.1427 \\
                                        1.1427 & 1.4498 \\
                                      \end{array}
                                    \right).
\end{equation}

\citet{roy} notes that these are the same estimate for variance as given by \citet{BA99}.


The repeatability coefficients are determined to be $0.9080$ for the RV method and $1.0293$ for the IC method.

From the estimated $\boldsymbol{\Omega_{i}}$ correlation matrix, the overall correlation coefficient is $0.7100$.
The overall correllation coefficients between two methods RV and IC are $0.9384$ and $0.9131$ respectively.

\citet{roy} concludes that is appropriate to switch between the two methods if needed.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Example 4 Coronary Artery Calcium data%

\citet{haber}

\citet{roy} recommends to not switch between the two method.
