\subsection{Formal testing for covariances }
As it is pertinent to the difference between the two described methodologies, the facilitation of a formal test would be useful. Extending the approach proposed by Roy, the test for overall covariance can be formulated:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\operatorname{H_5} : \sigma_{12} = 0 \\
\operatorname{K_5} : \sigma_{12} \neq 0
\end{eqnarray*}
As with the tests for variability, this test is performed by comparing a pair of model fits corresponding to the null and alternative hypothesis. In addition to testing the overall covariance, similar tests can be formulated for both the component variabilities if necessary.
